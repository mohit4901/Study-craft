from django.contrib import admin

# In this project, data persistence is primarily handled by Firebase Firestore.
# If you were to define Django models in api/models.py, you would register them
# here to make them manageable via the Django admin interface.

# Example:
# from .models import StudyPlan
# admin.site.register(StudyPlan)
